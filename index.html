	My name is Shulamit and my husband's name is Meir 
			We got married exactly eight months ago!
			And we began to live our new life together,
			

	<br>In the first month we enjoyed life, we traveled, we had fun, we went out and even bought plane tickets to Austria for a honeymoon and then the corona arrived and like the rest of the world, we also changed our plans.
	<br>We just got the movie of the wedding so this was the first show to close. He was amazing and very exciting.
	<br>That's how we actually stayed in both of our houses and now I can say that this time did us the best there is! We got to know each other in the most personal and amazing way which for other couples can take years we took two months of isolation.
	<br>After two months the country began to open slowly we decided to go to a zimer in the north we found something very nice in the village of Safsufa and spent a weekend there. On Friday we went down to the Sea of Galilee and did a cruise. It was really nice B"H.

		We started looking for new furniture to design our living room
		
			
			<h2>For example:</h2>
			<ul>
			      <li>sofa</li>
				  <li>Dining Table</li>
				  <li>glass table</li>
				  <li>Bookcase</li>
				  <li>Showcase</li>
				  <li>Mirror</li>
				  <li>Wall clock</li>
			</ul>
			
			And of course there is more and more. It is always good to add and decorate
